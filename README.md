# Landing Page Project

## Description

The project uses Javascript to display a dynamic version of the Landing Page project skeleton from Udacity.

Sections are actively highlighted while scrolling, and clicking on any section on the top navbar will scroll the relevant section to the top of the window just below the navbar.

Additionally, pressing any key while on this page will create an additional section on the page. The navbar will update accordingly, and the new section retains the same functionality as the original sections. Refreshing the page resets the number of sections to the original three.
